Learning Angular programming

Hello, I'm in the process of learning AngularJS I'm running into some issues i could use help.
I uploaded two images to give you a perspective as to whats happening.

As you can see the right side which should display the details of the user but in this instance its displaying the user list again.
I'm a bit lost as to what I'm doing wrong.I'm not sure if I have the router-outlet in the wrong place or i simply don't have the dashboard.route.module.ts configured correctly. 

any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated
